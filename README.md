**🥤Coca-Cola Stock Analysis** 

Excel → Python → EDA → Machine Learning → Live Stock Concept

**📌Project Overview**

This project presents an end-to-end stock market analysis of The Coca-Cola Company (KO) using a real-world workflow followed by data analysts.

The analysis begins in Microsoft Excel for data cleaning, pivot tables, and chart creation.
The cleaned dataset is then uploaded to Google Colab for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), visualization, and machine learning-based price prediction using Python.

The project also demonstrates a live stock data fetching concept to show how real-time predictions can be integrated.
